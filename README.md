## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the AI image generation API.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs quickly.

## Setup Instructions

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parthavpovil/misimagine.git
   cd misimagine
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

## Using the Stability AI API

This project uses the Stability AI API for generating images. Users will need to create an account to obtain an API key. 

1. Visit the [Stability AI Platform](https://platform.stability.ai/).
2. Sign up for a free account. They offer free credits for new users, which you can use to test the API.
3. After registering, you will receive an API key. Replace the placeholder key in the code with your actual API key to enable image generation.

Make sure to keep your API key private and do not share it in public repositories.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.
